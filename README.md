# AFT (Audio Format Test)

Audio files in various filetypes that say their formats out loud and then, when applicable, play a short stereo test. When possible, all files have the most common metadata tags filled out â€“ title, artist, album, genre, year, track number, and comment.

The files on the repository are the source WAV files. The test files themselves are available on the releases page.
